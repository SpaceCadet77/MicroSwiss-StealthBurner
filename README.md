# MicroSwiss-StealthBurner
Voron StealthBurner modified to work with a MicroSwiss Direct drive extruder system.

## Feb 11, 2022: 
- Added Cable tie on right side (Fan_System_V5.stl)
- Added solid extrusion to remove the front logo through hole. This is used in the case you do not want to add an LED logo. (Fan_System_V5.stl)
- Added Extrusion Knob V1
- Removed sectioned required for clockwork 2, unneeded for this mod. (Fan_System_V5.stl)

Files:
- back_plate_mount_CRTouch_V4.stl
- back_plate_mount_No_Probe_V4.stl
- Duct_System_V4.stl
- Fan_System_V5.stl


## Feb 4, 2022:
- This does not require any hardware modifications.
- This is still a beta design, as reverse engineering an STL is difficult.

Files:
- back_plate_mount_CRTouch_V4.stl
- back_plate_mount_No_Probe_V4.stl
- Duct_System_V4.stl
- Fan_System_V4.stl


Stay tuned for an additional modifications:

Extruder wheel (In Progress)
Extruder wheel side cutout of Fan System body (In Progress)
Wire management

Notes:
- The back plate and Duct System are currently attached with 4 M3*10 mm cap screws. This was to reduce a moment. After installation, it seams one screw on each side is sufficient.
- The Duct System and Back Mounting Plate are designed to use M3 threaded insert's (Red).
- There are 4 mounting locations (Green), I tapped the two wheel holes on the back mounting plate with a 1/4-20 tap. After mounting realized that's maybe a bit overkill, we'll see.
- After calibrating my CR-Touch, my offset was -1.94, But please don't trust this value, as yours will be different. Probe to Nozzle was around 44, and 7 mm. This is mounted with 2 M3 screws, I did not use threaded inserts for this, but simply tapped the PETG.
- The Duct system currently requires supports for the top two "ears". I can probably redesign this with a 45 degree slope.
